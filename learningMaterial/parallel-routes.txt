Parallel routes means render multiple pages simultaneously in one layout.

Lets think of a scenario where we have to build a complex dashboard with users analytics, revenue and notifications.
This can be achieved by the components, we can create 3 components and render in layout, but the efficient way is to do with parallel routes.

In order to create a parallel route the name of route folder start with the @. So lets create a parent folder "complex-dashboard" and the 3 parallel route folders with page.js file inside.

The parallel route folders automatically becomes the prop of the layout, we dont have to import these, just pass them to the props and we are all set.

The parallel route also called slots.

IMPORTANT THING is that the slots or parallel route is not a route segments means if you try to navigate "complex-dashboard/users" or "complex-dashboard/@users" we get not-found page.

================= EXAMPLE OF PARALLEL ROUTE ==================
export default function DashboardLayout({
  children,
  users,
  revenue,
  notifications,
}) {
  return (
    <div>
      <div>{children}</div>

      <div className="flex">
        <div className="flex flex-col">
          <div>{users}</div>
          <div>{revenue}</div>
        </div>
        <div className="flex">{notifications}</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

=============================
Parallel routes Use Cases:
1. Dashboard with multiple sections.
2. Split-view Interfaces.
3. Multi-pane Layouts.
4. Complex Admin Interfaces.

Parallel Routes Benefits:
1. Independent Route Handling
    Each slot in layout like in our example Users, Revenue and Notifications can handle its own loading and error states.
    This granular controls is particularly useful in scenarios where different slots load at varying speed or encounter unique errors.

2. Sub-Navigation
    Each slot works as a mini application with its own navigation and state management. User can interact with these navigations without disturbing the whole application.

    Lets take a scenario where the users navigate between notifications and archived notifications.

    SO lets create a new routing folder "archived" inside the @notifications folder.
